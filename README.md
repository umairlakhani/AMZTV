## Prerequisites

* Virtual (TV emulator on Android Studio) or physical device ([**Fire TV**](https://www.amazon.com/firetv) or [**Fire TV Stick**](https://www.amazon.com/firetvstick))
* **Media feed with necessary elements.** If you want to use your own custom media feed, you will need a media feed (in either JSON or XML format) with video assets as well as the following feed elements: title, ID, description, URL, card image, and background image. Any video format supported by [Exoplayer](https://google.github.io/ExoPlayer/supported-formats.html) is compatible with Fire App Builder
